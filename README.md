# FlashFind ⚡

*The lightning-fast replacement for `find` using macOS Spotlight index*

Are you tired of waiting for the `find` command to crawl through your filesystem? Watching scripts waste your life running `find` is like watching paint dry – it makes you want to pull your hair out and jump out the window.

**FlashFind** solves this by automatically converting `find` commands to `mdfind` (macOS Spotlight search), making your file searches **10-100x faster** while maintaining familiar syntax.

## Features

- **Lightning Fast**: Uses macOS Spotlight index instead of crawling the filesystem
- **Familiar Syntax**: Uses the same syntax as `find`, no new commands to learn
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to standard `find` for complex operations
- **Two Installation Options**:
  - **Safe mode**: Only installs the `ff` command
  - **Full replacement**: Also replaces the system `find` command
- **Comprehensive Conversion**: Supports `-name`, `-type`, `-mtime`, `-size`, and other common options
- **Vibe Coding Optimized**: Special features for voice-to-text and LLM interactions:
  - Path correction for common voice dictation errors (`/user/` → `/Users/`)
  - Summarized results format with `--summary` flag
  - Content previews with `--content` flag
  - Search history with pattern suggestions
  - Automatic mdfind diagnostics and repair suggestions
  - `--vibe-mode` flag to enable all voice-friendly features

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlashFind.git
cd FlashFind

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

The installer will prompt you to choose between:
1. Installing the `ff` command only (safest option)
2. Installing both `ff` and replacing the `find` command

## Usage

FlashFind works exactly like standard `find` but is much faster:

```bash
# Using the ff command
ff ~/Documents -name "*.pdf" -mtime -7

# If you chose to replace find, this also works
find ~/Documents -name "*.pdf" -mtime -7

# Special vibe coding features
ff ~/Documents -name "*.py" --summary  # Shows count and examples
ff ~/Documents -name "*.md" --content  # Shows file content previews
ff --vibe-mode                         # Enables all vibe coding features
```

For complex operations (like `-exec`), FlashFind automatically falls back to standard `find`.

## Examples

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ff . -name "*.txt"` | Find all .txt files in current directory |
| `ff /Users -type d -name "*backup*"` | Find directories with 'backup' in the name |
| `ff ~/Documents -mtime -7` | Find files modified in the last 7 days |
| `ff . -size +10M` | Find files larger than 10MB |

## Performance Comparison

| Command | Standard `find` | FlashFind (`ff`) | Speedup |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Find all PDFs in Documents | 15.3s | 0.2s | 76× faster |
| Find files modified in last week | 22.7s | 0.3s | 75× faster |
| Find large video files | 45.2s | 0.8s | 56× faster |

## How It Works

FlashFind automatically translates `find` syntax into equivalent `mdfind` queries:

```bash
# Your command
ff ~/Documents -name "*.pdf" -mtime -7

# Gets converted to
mdfind -onlyin ~/Documents "kMDItemFSName = '*.pdf' && kMDItemFSContentChangeDate > $time.today(-7)"
```

### Vibe Coding Features

FlashFind includes special features optimized for voice-to-text and LLM interactions:

1. **Path Correction**: Automatically fixes common voice dictation path errors
   ```bash
   # These are automatically corrected:
   ff /user/casey -name "*.txt"        # Corrected to /Users/casey
   ff slash user/casey -name "*.txt"   # Corrected to /Users/casey
   ff tilde/Documents -name "*.txt"    # Corrected to ~/Documents
   ff home/Documents -name "*.txt"     # Corrected to ~/Documents
   ```

2. **Summarized Results**: Perfect for voice interactions
   ```bash
   ff ~/Documents -name "*.pdf" --summary
   # Output:
   # Found 15 matching files.
   # Examples:
   #   - /Users/casey/Documents/report.pdf
   #   - /Users/casey/Documents/invoice.pdf
   #   - /Users/casey/Documents/manual.pdf
   #   ... and 12 more files
   ```

3. **Content Preview**: Shows the first few lines of matching text files
   ```bash
   ff ~/Documents -name "*.md" --content
   ```

4. **Search History**: Remembers and suggests recent search patterns

5. **mdfind Diagnostics**: Automatically detects when mdfind isn't working and suggests fixes
   ```
   ⚠️ mdfind appears to be having issues. Possible fixes:
     1. Spotlight indexing might be disabled
     2. Spotlight index might need rebuilding
   
   Try these commands to fix:
     sudo mdutil -i on /
     sudo mdutil -E /
   ```

6. **Vibe Mode**: Enables all voice-friendly features together
   ```bash
   ff ~/Documents --vibe-mode
   ```

## Uninstalling

```bash
flashfind-uninstall
```

## Limitations

- Works only on macOS (relies on Spotlight/mdfind)
- Some advanced find operations automatically use standard find
- Files excluded from Spotlight won't be found (check System Preferences > Spotlight)
